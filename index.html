            <h1>A Love Letter to a Giant</h1>
            <h2>A Conventional Google</h2>
            <p class="disclaimer">I am a Googler who wrote this on my own time about my own opinions.</p>
            <p>Google wasn't designed to be a conventional company. This is what Google founders Larry and Sergey repeatedly declared in their IPO letter, "An Owner's Manual for Google's Shareholder". Google in its early years revolutionized the world repeatedly with technologies like Gmail, Maps, Drive, YouTube, Android, and Chrome. Unlike most firms that stick to their "primary expertise" or adopt new technologies, Google consistently innovates and revolutionizes.</p>
            <p>I have been at Google now for seven years. I have witnessed a constant struggle with Google's identity, what it means to be googley, and whether or not it has finally become a conventional company. 2024 may contain the clearest evidence of Google becoming a truly conventional company. The Google of the 2000s wouldn't have engaged in illegal anti-competitive behavior. Nor would it have invented AI technology, have failed to bring it to market, and only to play catchup seven years later.</p>
