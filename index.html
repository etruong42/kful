            <h1>A Love Letter to a Giant</h1>
            <h2>a Conventional Google</h2>
            <p class="disclaimer">I am a Googler who wrote this on my own time about my own opinions.</p>
            <p>Google wasn't designed to be a conventional company. This is what Google founders Larry and Sergey repeatedly declared in their IPO letter, <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/founders-letters/ipo-letter/">"An Owner's Manual for Google's Shareholder"</a>. Google in its early years revolutionized the world repeatedly with technologies like Gmail, Maps, Drive, YouTube, Android, and Chrome. Unlike most firms that stick to their "primary expertise" or adopt new technologies, Google consistently innovated and revolutionized the world. Instead of following the market, Google consistently led the market and raised the bar for all technology companies.</p>
            <p>I have been at Google now for seven years. I have witnessed a constant struggle with Google's identity, what it means to be googley, and whether or not it has finally become a conventional company. 2024 may contain the clearest evidence of Google becoming a truly conventional company. The Google of the 2000s wouldn't have engaged in illegal anti-competitive behavior. Nor would it have invented AI technology in 2017, failed to bring it to market, and only play catchup when a different technology company, OpenAI, brings the seven-year-old technology to market.</p>
            <p>Googleyness, a core idea of Google culture, embodies its unconventional roots. Googleyness is difficult to describe, and everyone has different ideas on what googleyness is, exactly. To contrast googleyness, I describe a conventional culture in the modern era to be consisting of
                <span class="highlight-1">de facto patronages</span> that incentivizes people to fight for <span class="highlight-2">political authority</span> by <span class="highlight-3">hoarding information to shape narratives</span>.</p>
            <p>The primary goal of this letter will be to try to describe what a conventional company might look like compared to an alternative like a "Googley" one. I will share with you my direct observations and what I extrapolate them to mean for the culture as a whole. Perhaps we can take another step closer to how a company has regressed from a company that was always raising the bar to a company that can only follow when other people innovate.</p>

                <h2>A Tale of Two Googles</h2>
                <p>Allow me to start with an anecdote with my direct observations containing most of the most salient properties of Googleyness. It started with a draft of a roadmap. The authors, reviews, and approvers of this roadmap included illustrious Google fellows and directors managing thousands of engineers. I disagreed with one of the draft decisions, and I left a comment to that effect. This evoked a response, and a written debate ensued to refine our respective points and stances. This was followed up by multiple meetings with very senior engineers (seniority levels at Google go up to L10, and these meetings included L6, L8, and L9). At this point, I understood more of the complexities behind our disagreement, and I never realized that this disagreement would call the attention of such senior levels. I have written many opinions during my time at Google, and many were ignored. Even so, I restated the gist of my original point and made some clarifications in response to questions and comments in these meetings.</p>
                <p>Other than my initial comment on the roadmap, I did not initiate anything else. I responded to comments, and I attended these meetings to which I was invited. I was pleased to simply get my opinion on the record. Actually, I was more than pleased at the opportunity to refine my ideas through vigorous debate, and to better understand the original position that I disagreed with. And after all that debate, I could see the argument going in either direction, although I personally preferred my own argument of course. I was surprised a couple of months later that they had reversed their original stance in the final, published roadmap and adopted the stance I advocated.</p>
